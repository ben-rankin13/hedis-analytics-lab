# hedis-analytics-lab
This project simulates the logic behind **HEDIS (Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set)** quality measures using SQL and synthetic healthcare data. It serves as a hands-on lab and portfolio to demonstrate skills in healthcare analytics, data modeling, and measure evaluation.

## 🔍 What You'll Find Here

- SQL logic for calculating HEDIS quality measures (starting with Breast Cancer Screening)
- Synthetic patient datasets based on realistic schemas
- Detailed documentation aligned with NCQA technical specs
- Optional dashboards (Power BI, Tableau, or Python) for reporting results
- Scalable repo structure for additional measures

## 💡 Goals

- Practice healthcare measure logic using SQL
- Demonstrate ability to work with health plan performance data
- Build a portfolio-ready project relevant to roles in payer analytics, quality improvement, or health IT
